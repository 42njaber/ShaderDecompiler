# Shader Decompiler

This project is a WIP utility to make RoR2 shaders decompiled by uTinyRipper usable in the Unity Editor

For now, only made to be functional on "hg" shaders, as well as "efficientblur", "fillcrop", "underwaterfog" and "ProjectorLight", because I'm not sure if those shaders come from plugins or not
